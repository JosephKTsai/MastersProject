        <h1> Welcome to the personalized security recommendations tool</h1>
        <p> The tool intakes user input based on their current security posture, and generates personalized recommendations based on guidance from security professionals.</p>
    
        <h2> How the recommendations were generated</h2>
        <p> A group of 12 security professionals were asked questions related to home user security. From the group discussions, major threats and corresponding mitigations were identified. These threats and mitigations have been translated into the survey for easy use of home users to evaluate their own security posture.</p>
